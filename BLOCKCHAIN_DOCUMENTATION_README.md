   - [ ] Share GitHub repository link
   - [ ] Prepare architecture diagram to show on screen

### During the Demo:

1. **Introduction (1 min)**
   - Open with: "This is built on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with smart contracts in Go"
   - Show [BLOCKCHAIN_VS_WEBSITE.md](./BLOCKCHAIN_VS_WEBSITE.md) comparison table

2. **Show Infrastructure (3 min)**
   - Show chaincode files in VS Code
   - Show `docker ps` with Fabric containers
   - Show network configuration

3. **Live Demonstration (5 min)**
   - Deploy Fabric network (`./scripts/deploy-all.sh`)

## üîë Key Proof Points

When your professor asks "How do I know this is blockchain?", show these:

### 1. **Smart Contracts in Go**
```bash
cat chaincode/property-contract/property.go | head -50
```
Point out:
- Line 8: `import "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go/contractapi"`
- Line 95: `ctx.GetStub().PutState()` - writes to blockchain ledger

### 2. **Fabric Network Running**
```bash
docker ps
```
Point out: orderer, peer, CA containers (not just web + database)

### 3. **Fabric Connection**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health | jq
```
Point out: `"mode": "FABRIC"`, `"fabricConnected": true`

### 4. **Cryptographic Transaction IDs**
Register property via UI, show server logs with transaction hash

### 5. **Direct Blockchain Query**
```bash
docker exec cli peer chaincode query \
  -C landregistry \
  -n property-contract \
  -c '{"Args":["GetAllProperties"]}'
```
Point out: This bypasses REST API - queries blockchain directly!

## üí° Quick Tips

### If Time is Limited (5 minutes):

Use [BLOCKCHAIN_VS_WEBSITE.md](./BLOCKCHAIN_VS_WEBSITE.md) and show:
1. Chaincode file with Fabric SDK imports (30 sec)
2. Docker containers running Fabric network (30 sec)
3. Health endpoint showing Fabric connection (30 sec)
4. Register property ‚Üí show transaction ID (2 min)
5. Direct CLI query of blockchain (1 min)

**Say:** "Smart contracts in Go, Fabric network in Docker, cryptographic IDs, and direct ledger queries prove this is real blockchain."

### If Professor is Skeptical:

1. Show `chaincode/` directory - these are Go files with Fabric SDK
2. Show `crypto-config/` - PKI certificates for blockchain identity
3. Show peer logs - actual blockchain block commits
4. Query blockchain directly - data exists outside your REST API

### Common Questions:

**Q: "Can't you just fake this?"**
A: "The peer logs show actual Hyperledger Fabric consensus. The CLI queries bypass our API entirely and query the distributed ledger directly. We can check the transaction hash on the blockchain."

**Q: "Why not just use a database?"**
A: "Databases allow UPDATE/DELETE which destroys audit trail. Blockchain provides immutable, cryptographically verified records required for land registry."

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your demonstration is successful if your professor understands:

- ‚úÖ Smart contracts are written in Go (not JavaScript/Python)
- ‚úÖ Data is stored on distributed ledger (not SQL database)
- ‚úÖ Transactions are cryptographically verified
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail is immutably preserved
- ‚úÖ System uses enterprise blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)
- ‚úÖ This is fundamentally different from a regular website

## üÜò Need Help?

### If Fabric network won't start:
```bash
cd /home/user/aura/scripts
./cleanup.sh
./deploy-all.sh
```

### If backend can't connect:
```bash
cd /home/user/aura/backend
node enroll-admin.js
node server-with-fabric.js
```

### If demo isn't working:
- Fall back to showing code (chaincode files)
- Show docker-compose.yml with Fabric services
- Show connection-profile.json proving Fabric integration
- Explain you're in development mode but can connect to Fabric
