# Quick Reference Card for Live Demo

**Print this out or keep it visible during the demonstration!**

## 🎯 Demo Flow (15 minutes)

1. **Show Infrastructure** (2 min) → Chaincode files, network config
2. **Current State** (2 min) → Check MOCK mode, show SDK code
3. **Deploy Fabric** (4 min) → Run deploy-all.sh, verify containers
4. **Connect Backend** (2 min) → Enroll admin, start Fabric server
5. **Submit Transaction** (3 min) → Register property via UI
6. **Prove Immutability** (2 min) → Query ledger directly

---

## 📝 Essential Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Check Current Mode
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health | jq
```

### Show Project Structure
```bash
cd /home/user/aura && tree -L 2 chaincode/
```

### Deploy Blockchain Network
```bash
cd /home/user/aura/scripts && ./deploy-all.sh
```

### Verify Network Running
```bash
docker ps | grep landregistry
```

### Enroll Admin
```bash
cd /home/user/aura/backend && node enroll-admin.js
```

### Start Fabric Server
```bash
cd /home/user/aura/backend && node server-with-fabric.js
```

### Verify Fabric Connection
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health | jq
```

### View Peer Logs
```bash
docker logs peer0.landregistry.gov.in --tail 50
```

### Query Blockchain Ledger
```bash
docker exec cli peer chaincode query \
  -C landregistry \
  -n property-contract \
  -c '{"Args":["GetAllProperties"]}'
```

### Show Block Info
```bash
docker exec cli peer channel getinfo -c landregistry
```

## 🔑 Key Files to Show

| File | Line | What to Point Out |
|------|------|-------------------|
| `chaincode/property-contract/property.go` | 8 | Fabric SDK import |
| `chaincode/property-contract/property.go` | 95 | PutState → writes to blockchain |
| `chaincode/offer-contract/offer.go` | 73 | Immutable offer storage |
| `backend/server-with-fabric.js` | 106 | Gateway connects to Fabric |
| `backend/server-with-fabric.js` | 133 | submitTransaction to blockchain |
| `basic-network/docker-compose.yml` | - | Orderer, Peer, CA services |

---

## 💬 Key Phrases to Say

### When showing chaincode:
> "This smart contract uses the Hyperledger Fabric SDK. The PutState function writes directly to the blockchain ledger, not a database."

### When showing MOCK→FABRIC transition:
> "Notice the mode changes from MOCK to FABRIC. Now all transactions go through the blockchain network."

### When showing transaction logs:
> "See this cryptographic transaction ID? This is permanently recorded on the blockchain ledger."

### When querying ledger directly:
> "This CLI query bypasses our REST API entirely, proving the data is actually on the blockchain."

### When professor asks "How is this different from a database?":
> "Databases allow UPDATE/DELETE that destroy history. Blockchain is append-only and immutable. Every change creates a new block."

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If deploy-all.sh fails:
```bash
cd /home/user/aura/scripts
./cleanup.sh
./deploy-all.sh
```

### If server can't connect to Fabric:
```bash
# Check containers are running
docker ps

# Check admin enrollment
ls /home/user/aura/backend/wallet/
```

### If port 3001 is busy:
```bash
pkill -f "node server"
```

### If Docker containers aren't running:
```bash
cd /home/user/aura/basic-network
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📊 Evidence Checklist

Mark these off as you show them:

- [ ] Chaincode files in Go with Fabric SDK imports
- [ ] Docker containers running (peer, orderer, CA)
- [ ] Server logs showing "Connected to Fabric network"
- [ ] Health check showing `"mode": "FABRIC"`
- [ ] Browser registering property (UI interaction)
- [ ] Terminal showing transaction ID with hash
- [ ] Peer logs showing block commits
- [ ] Direct CLI query of blockchain ledger
- [ ] Transaction IDs in response JSON

---

## 🎓 Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from a database?**
A: Database = mutable, can DELETE. Blockchain = immutable, append-only with complete history.

**Q: Can't you fake the transaction IDs?**
A: No - they're cryptographic hashes generated by Fabric network's consensus protocol.

**Q: How do I know it's real blockchain?**
A: Three proofs: (1) Go smart contracts with Fabric SDK, (2) Server logs showing Fabric connection, (3) Direct CLI queries bypassing REST API.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Yes - Hyperledger Fabric is used by IBM, Walmart, Maersk. Same tech stack, configured for dev environment.

## ⚡ If Time is Limited (5-minute version)

1. Show chaincode file: `cat chaincode/property-contract/property.go | head -50`
2. Show running Fabric network: `docker ps`
3. Show Fabric connection: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health`
4. Register property via UI → Show transaction ID in server logs
5. Query blockchain: `docker exec cli peer chaincode query ...`

**Say:** "Smart contracts in Go, Fabric network running in Docker, cryptographic transaction IDs, and direct ledger queries prove this is real blockchain."

---

## 📸 Screenshots to Take (Before Demo)

1. VS Code showing `property.go` with Fabric imports
2. `docker ps` showing Fabric containers
3. Server logs showing "Connected to Fabric network"
4. Health endpoint showing `"fabricConnected": true`
5. Terminal with CLI query results

## ✅ Success = Professor Understands

- Smart contracts deployed on blockchain (not regular API)
- Data in distributed ledger (not SQL)
- Transactions are immutable + cryptographically verified
- Complete audit trail maintained
- Enterprise blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)

---

## 🎬 Opening Line

> "Professor, I'd like to demonstrate that this is not a regular website with a database. It's built on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with smart contracts written in Go. Let me show you three levels of proof: the smart contracts themselves, the blockchain network infrastructure, and direct queries to the distributed ledger."

---

## 🎬 Closing Line

> "As you've seen, this system uses genuine blockchain technology with smart contracts, distributed ledger storage, cryptographic verification, and immutable audit trails. The presence of Go chaincodes, Fabric SDK integration, peer network logs, and direct ledger queries proves this is built on enterprise blockchain, not a conventional database-backed website."

**Good luck! You've got this! 🚀**
