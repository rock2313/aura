# Testing Guide - Blockchain Integration

## Overview
The frontend is now fully integrated with mockDataStore, which uses localStorage to persist data and automatically track all blockchain transactions.

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. Data Persistence
- All user, property, offer, and escrow data is now stored in localStorage
- Data persists across page refreshes
- No more mock/hardcoded data

### 2. Transaction Tracking
- âœ… **Transactions start empty** (no pre-populated data)
- âœ… **Transactions append automatically** when you:
  - Register a property
  - Create an offer
  - Accept/reject an offer
  - Admin verifies a transaction
  - Complete a property transfer

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Removed confusing role selection (everyone is "USER")
- Users can both buy AND sell properties
- Admin accesses system via `/admin` route directly
- Registration now works without errors
- Wallet connection is optional

## Complete Testing Workflow

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('landchain_mock_data')
```

## Key Features

### Auto-Refresh
- Transactions page auto-refreshes every 2 seconds
- You'll see new transactions appear automatically

### Search & Filter
- Search transactions by ID, property ID, type, status, or user
- Real-time filtering

### Data Persistence
- All data persists in localStorage
- Survives page refreshes
- Can be cleared via browser console

### Transaction Types
1. **PROPERTY_REGISTERED** - When property is added
2. **OFFER_CREATED** - When buyer makes offer
3. **OFFER_ACCEPTED** - When seller accepts offer
4. **OFFER_REJECTED** - When seller rejects offer
5. **OFFER_VERIFIED** - When admin verifies on Sepolia
6. **PROPERTY_TRANSFERRED** - When property ownership transfers

### Transaction Statuses
1. **COMPLETED** - Property registration complete
2. **PENDING** - Offer awaiting action
3. **VERIFIED** - Admin verified on blockchain
4. **CANCELLED** - Offer rejected/cancelled

## Troubleshooting

### Transactions Not Appearing
1. Open browser console
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify localStorage has data:
   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('landchain_mock_data'))
   ```

### Registration Failed
1. Clear localStorage and try again
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure all required fields are filled

### Data Not Persisting
1. Verify localStorage is enabled in browser
2. Check if private/incognito mode is blocking localStorage
3. Try a different browser

## Development Notes

### Data Storage Location
- **Key:** `landchain_mock_data`
- **Format:** JSON object with arrays for users, properties, offers, transactions, escrows

### Clear All Data
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('landchain_mock_data')
```

### View All Transactions
```javascript
const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('landchain_mock_data'))
console.table(data.transactions)
```

### View All Properties
```javascript
const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('landchain_mock_data'))
console.table(data.properties)
```

### View All Offers
```javascript
const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('landchain_mock_data'))
console.table(data.offers)
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test the complete workflow above
