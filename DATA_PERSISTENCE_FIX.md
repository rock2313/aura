# Data Persistence Fix - Properties Now Survive Backend Restarts

## Problem Identified

The issue you reported ("properties are getting registered but not appearing in frontend") was caused by **in-memory storage without persistence**.

### Root Cause:
- Backend servers (`server.js` and `server-with-fabric.js`) stored data only in memory
- Every time the backend restarted, ALL data was lost
- Properties registered through the frontend disappeared after backend restart
- This created the illusion that properties weren't being saved at all

## Solution Implemented

Added **file-based persistence** to both backend servers:

### Changes Made:

1. **Data Storage File**: `backend/data-store.json`
   - All data (users, properties, offers, transactions) persisted to this file
   - Data survives server restarts

2. **Auto-Save Mechanism**:
   - Data saves automatically every 10 seconds
   - Immediate save after every data modification
   - Save on graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)

3. **Auto-Load on Startup**:
   - Server loads existing data from file when starting
   - Console message shows: `📂 Loaded data from file: { users: X, properties: Y, ... }`

4. **Files Updated**:
   - `backend/server.js` - Mock-only backend
   - `backend/server-with-fabric.js` - Hybrid Fabric/Mock backend
   - `src/pages/Properties.tsx` - Added debug logging
   - `.gitignore` - Excluded data-store.json from git

## Testing Results

Verified the fix works correctly:

```bash
# 1. Registered a test property
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/properties/register ...
# Result: Property created successfully

# 2. Verified property was saved to file
cat backend/data-store.json
# Result: Property data present in file

# 3. Restarted backend server
# Result: Server showed "📂 Loaded data from file: { properties: 1, ... }"

# 4. Queried properties after restart
curl http://localhost:3001/api/properties
# Result: Property still present after restart! ✅
```

## How to Use

### For Your Local Machine:

1. **Pull the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin claude/session-011CUYvJ3pst6FXSWeh2Dedt
   ```

2. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   # OR for Fabric mode:
   # node server-with-fabric.js
   ```

3. **You should see**:
   ```
   📂 Loaded data from file: { users: 0, properties: 0, ... }
   🚀 LandChain Backend Server Started
   📍 URL: http://localhost:3001
   ```

4. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Register a property**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Navigate to "Add Property"
   - Fill in the form and submit
   - Property will be saved to `backend/data-store.json`

6. **Verify persistence**:
   - Go to "Properties" page - property should appear
   - Restart the backend server
   - Refresh the Properties page - property still appears! ✅

## Key Benefits

✅ **Data Persists**: Properties survive backend restarts
✅ **Automatic Backups**: Data saved every 10 seconds
✅ **Immediate Saves**: No data loss on crashes
✅ **Cross-Browser**: Data shared across all browser tabs
✅ **Cross-Session**: Data available after closing browser

## Data File Location

```
backend/data-store.json
```

This file contains:
- All registered users
- All registered properties
- All created offers
- All transaction records
- All escrow data

**Note**: This file is excluded from git (in `.gitignore`) as it contains generated data.

## Console Messages

When backend starts, you'll see:
```
📂 Loaded data from file: { users: 2, properties: 5, offers: 1, transactions: 8 }
```

After each save:
```
💾 Data saved to file
```

## Troubleshooting

### If properties still don't appear:

1. **Check backend is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
   # Should return: {"status": "OK", ...}
   ```

2. **Check data file exists**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh backend/data-store.json
   # Should show the file with size > 0
   ```

3. **Check data file contents**:
   ```bash
   cat backend/data-store.json
   # Should show your properties
   ```

4. **Check frontend is calling backend**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for: `🌐 API Request: GET http://localhost:3001/api/properties`
   - Look for: `✅ API Response: {success: true, data: [...]}`

5. **Restart both servers**:
   ```bash
   # Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
   # Stop frontend (Ctrl+C)

   # Start backend
   cd backend && node server.js

   # Start frontend (in new terminal)
   npm run dev
   ```

## What Changed in the Code

### backend/server.js and backend/server-with-fabric.js:

```javascript
// NEW: File-based persistence
const DATA_FILE = path.join(__dirname, 'data-store.json');

// Load data on startup
function loadData() {
  if (fs.existsSync(DATA_FILE)) {
    return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(DATA_FILE, 'utf8'));
  }
  return { users: [], properties: [], offers: [], transactions: [], escrows: [] };
}

// Save data to file
function saveData() {
  fs.writeFileSync(DATA_FILE, JSON.stringify(store, null, 2));
  console.log('💾 Data saved to file');
}

// Auto-save every 10 seconds
setInterval(saveData, 10000);

// Load data on startup
const store = loadData();

// Save after each operation
app.post('/api/properties/register', (req, res) => {
  // ... register property ...
  store.properties.push(propertyData);
  createTransaction(...); // This calls saveData() internally
  res.json({ success: true, ... });
});
```

## Summary

The issue was **NOT** with the frontend or API integration. The backend was working correctly, but data was only stored in memory and disappeared on restart.

Now with file-based persistence:
- ✅ Properties persist across restarts
- ✅ Transactions persist across restarts
- ✅ Data shared across all browser tabs
- ✅ No data loss on server crashes
- ✅ Your users can now register properties and see them reliably

## Next Steps

1. Pull the latest code
2. Test on your local machine
3. Verify properties now persist after backend restart
4. Continue with frontend-backend-Fabric integration
